**Warning: this program will be rewritten using Electron soon when I got my Playdate (probably in January 2024). Since C# is really Windows-oriented and there's already a Playdate Serial library in JS among other tools I thought why not integrating all those neat tools into one tiny package.**

# PlaySync

Source code for the Playdate sync tool

## TODO

- Device info panel: Battery status, serial number
- The whole interfacing with the device itself (COM-USB, reading serial number and battery percentage, data disk mode etc.)
- First plug in wizard that asks you if you want to download your current games to your local library
- Perhaps itch.io integration if I get that working

## Already done

- Basic UI
- Initial setup
- Serial interfacing
